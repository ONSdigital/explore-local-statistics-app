// to do

////// in generate-metadata - add timeDomain and valueDomain

// get latest git commit dates for downloaded json and csv
// compare to relevant dates from metadata for each indicator

// if either one has changed - that indicator goes on the list of potentially altered indicators
// include which one has changed

// also check for any indicators that don't exist
// if there are any, prompt edits to manifest-metadata

// check min and max date values of incoming data - compare to existing timeDomain from metadata
// if different, can add message about new time period?

// spit out a change log of some kind
