To see these figures presented visually, please refer to Figures 2 to 5 in [Foreign direct investment, experimental UK subnational estimates: 2021](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/articles/foreigndirectinvestmentexperimentaluksubnationalstatistics/2021).\n\n### Coverage \n\nGB (England, Wales and Scotland).

FDI is also defined by control relationships, where the direct investor (parent company) controls at least 10% of the voting power (ordinary shares) of the direct investment enterprise. These relationships can be measured in two directions: \n - outward: the direct investments of UK-resident companies in other countries \n - inward: the direct investments in the UK from non-resident companies \n\n\n",
