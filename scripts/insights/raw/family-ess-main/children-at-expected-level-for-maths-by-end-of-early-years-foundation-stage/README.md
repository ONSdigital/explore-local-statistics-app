## Changes made

### Period

Dates for this dataset are gregorian-interval.
This dataset uses Academic year which we don't have a template for
and I'm fairly certain there isnt a 'government-year/' alternative (eg 'academic-year/')
or at least I couldn't find any evidence of one


### Gross Geo-Stuff

Some Observtions have been removed.
The Observations in question are those that have `na` in the `AREAD` column as it corresponds to `Outside of England and unknown` which we currently do not support.
