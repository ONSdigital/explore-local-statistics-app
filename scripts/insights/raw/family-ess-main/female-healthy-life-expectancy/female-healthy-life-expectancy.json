    "description": "This dataset shows the average years expected to be lived in good health for females born during the reference period, in the United Kingdom, for calendar years 2011 - 2013 to 2018 - 2020.\n\n### Coverage \n\nUK\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nCounties and Unitary Authorities,\nWelsh Health Boards,\nMetropolitan counties,\nRegions,\nCombined Authorities,\nNations (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland),\nCountry (UK)\n\n### Source\n\n - United Kingdom: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/healthstatelifeexpectanciesuk/previousReleases#) \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
