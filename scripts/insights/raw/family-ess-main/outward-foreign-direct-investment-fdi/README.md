## Changes made

### Period

Dates for this dataset are calendar Year

### Gross Geo Stuff

This one is kinda a mess.\
Mixes ITL and StatsGeo codes, mostly ITL with 2 StatsGeo so removed the 2 StatsGeo.\
It looks like for a bunch of observations which used to also have StatsGeo codes they just replaced with na, so had to remove those\
Also they included a (seemingly) made up code for `UK not Allocated` (`TLX`) which I have removed.\
I have also changed the AREACD value for `UK` to be `all` as that is how it appears in the current ITL codelist.
