    "description": "This dataset shows the age-standardised mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases considered preventable for those aged under 75 per 100,000 population (2019 definition), based on 2011 Census mid-year population estimates, in England, for 2001 to 2020.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nCounties,\nRegions,\nCombined Authorities,\nNation (England) \n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Office for Health Improvement and Disparities](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework/data#page/9/gid/1000044/pat/159/par/K02000001/ati/15/are/E92000001/iid/93722/age/163/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/1/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \nThe data included in this time series are based on 2011 Census mid-year population estimates and therefore should not be used to make comparisons with the published 2021 data, which are based on Census 2021 mid-year population estimates.  \nValues for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are in a combined code (E67000002). Values for Hackney and City of London are in a combined code (E67000001). \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
