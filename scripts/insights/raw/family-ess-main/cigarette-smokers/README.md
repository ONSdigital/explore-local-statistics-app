### Gross Geo-Stuff

Some Geography codes have been made obsolete and therefore they have no observations\
In these cases the observation status has been set to z for 'not applicable'\
\
however, there are some cases where the code is obsolete yet we don't have an entry for the new code/codes\
it seems as though in these cases the value has been retained, and I've kept it without an observation status
