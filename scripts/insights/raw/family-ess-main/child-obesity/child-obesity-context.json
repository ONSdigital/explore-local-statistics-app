            "description": "This dataset shows the proportion of children aged 4-5 years (reception age) and 10-11 years (Year 6 age) classified as underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese (including severe obesity), in England, for academic years 2006/07 to 2022/23.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nCounties,\nRegions,\nCombined Authorities,\nNation (England) \n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Office for Health Improvement and Disparities](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/national-child-measurement-programme/data) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \nThe data presented only includes children participating in the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in state maintained schools, any measurements taken at independent and special schools are excluded from the analysis.\n\nChildren are classified as (centiles are of the British 1990 growth reference (UK90) according to age and sex):\n - Underweight if their body mass index (BMI) is less than the 2nd centile.\n - Healthy weight if their body mass index (BMI) is between the 2nd and less than the 85th centile.\n - Overweight if their body mass index (BMI) is on or above the 85th centile, but less than the 95th centile.\n - living with obesity if their body mass index (BMI) is on or above the 95th centile.\n\nValues for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are in a combined code (E67000002). Values for Hackney and City of London are in a combined code (E67000001). \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
