    "description": "This dataset shows the rate of homicide offences per million population, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for three-year rolling periods 04/2012-03/2015 to 04/2020-03/2023.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nRegions,\nPolice Force Area,\nNations (England, Wales, Northern Ireland),\nCountry (England and Wales)\n\n### Source\n\n - England and Wales: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/previousReleases#)\n\n - Northern Ireland: [Police Service of Northern Ireland](https://www.psni.police.uk/about-us/our-publications-and-reports/official-statistics/police-recorded-crime-statistics) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n\n- England and Wales data presented have been extracted from the Home Office Homicide Index which contains detailed record-level information about each homicide recorded by police in England and Wales. The Homicide Index is continually updated with revised information from the police as investigations continue and as cases are heard by the courts. The data refer to the position as at 12 December 2023. The data will change as subsequent court hearings take place or as further information is received.\n\n- Northern Ireland statistics on police recorded crime are collated and produced by statisticians seconded to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). They are recorded in compliance with the Home Office Counting Rules and further details of recording practices are available in the [User Guide to Police Recorded Crime Statistics](https://www.psni.police.uk/about-us/our-publications-and-reports/official-statistics/police-recorded-crime-statistics).\n\n- 2022 mid-year population estimates have been used to create a rate per million population.\n\n- Some of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures. \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
