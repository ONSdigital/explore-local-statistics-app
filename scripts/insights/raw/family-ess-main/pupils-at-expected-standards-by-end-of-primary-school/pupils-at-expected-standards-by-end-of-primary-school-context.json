            "description": "This dataset shows the percentage of pupils in state-funded schools meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at the end of key stage 2, in England state-funded schools, for academic years 2015/16 - 2023/24.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland (state-funded schools)\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nCounties and Unitary Authorities,\nRegions,\nNation (England)\n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Department for Education](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-2-attainment) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n- 'State-funded schools' includes LA maintained schools, sponsored academies, converter academies, free schools and state-funded special schools (including hospital schools).\n- Figures for 2024 are based on provisional data. Figures for other years are based on final data.\n- Data is not available for 2019/20 and 2020/21 academic years as assessments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks. \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
