This includes those who are resident outwith Scotland, those with no fixed abode and those with unknown residence.\n- Data includes underlying cause of death from coronary heart disease (ICD-10 code I20-I25) or cerebrovascular disease (ICD-10 code I60-I69).\n- Age standardised rates calculated using the direct method, standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP2013). National Records of Scotland Population Estimates were used in the calculation of the crude and standardised rates.",
