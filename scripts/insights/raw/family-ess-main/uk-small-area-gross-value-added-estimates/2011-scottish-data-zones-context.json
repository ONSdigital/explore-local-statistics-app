            "abstract": "Provides GVA estimates for data zones (DZ, Scotland), 1998 to 2020.",
            "description": "Gross value added (GVA) is the value generated by any economic unit that produces goods and services. It reflects the value of goods and services produced, less the cost of any inputs used up in that production process. GVA is a standard measure of the economic activity taking place in an area. It comprises the majority of gross domestic product (GDP), only excluding taxes and subsidies on products (such as Value Added Tax and duty on fuel or alcohol). GVA for the UK as a whole is measured by the UK National Accounts and published each year in the annual Blue Book. The GVA is then broken down to individual countries, regions, and local authority districts.\n\nThese experimental statistics continue the disaggregation of GVA figures to data zone (DZ, Scotland) level. The DZ data are building blocks that allow users the flexibility to build their own geographies for analysis. We do not recommend comparing the DZ data directly. Instead, we recommend using the building blocks to build up other areas of interest and/or to analyse small areas within larger areas of interest.\n\n### Coverage \n\nScotland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nData zones (DZ). These data are based on 2011 Census Geography. Users must use the appropriate lookup table.\n\n### Source\n\n - Scotland GVA estimates: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/articles/disaggregatingannualsubnationalgrossvalueaddedgvatolowerlevelsofgeography/1998to2020)\n\n - 2011 Census geography lookup tables: [2011 Data Zone Lookup](https://statistics.gov.scot/data/data-zone-lookup) \n\n\n",
