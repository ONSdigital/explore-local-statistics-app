# The Explore Subnational Statistics Linked CSV-W Data Store
This data set family supports the [Explore Subnational Statistics (ESS) Alpha](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/subnationalindicatorsexplorer/2022-01-06) Initiative of Office for National Statistics and provides low level geography data across many metrics for the United Kingdom's four nations.

## Cavaets on data
Many of these data sets are republications of other data from various providers. These CSV-Ws are considered draft until the data is republished on the [Integrated Data Service Data Explorer (IDS DE)](https://beta.gss-data.org.uk). These data are quality checked on IDS DE prior to publication.

## Future plans
These data will be updated periodically to support the ESS alpha project.
