    "description": "This dataset shows apprenticeships started by adults aged 16+ based on home address, rate per 100,000 population, in England, for full academic years 2017/18 to 2021/22. Figures for 2022/23 are available for August 2022 to January 2023.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nRegions,\nCounties,\nNation (England)\n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Department for Education](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/further-education-and-skills) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n- Starts for 2022/23 are provisional and cover August 2022 to January 2023. 2021/22 starts are finalised and cover the full academic year.\n- Starts are the count of apprenticeships started at any point during the stated academic period. Learners starting more than one apprenticeship will appear more than once.\n- Geography is based upon the home postcode of the learner. \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
