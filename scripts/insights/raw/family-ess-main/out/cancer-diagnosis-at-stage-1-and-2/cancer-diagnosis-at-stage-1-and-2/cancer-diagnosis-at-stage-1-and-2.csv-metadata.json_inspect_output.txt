		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both clinical and data quality arrangements, the ability to obtain stage data for cancer registrations was reduced for the 2019 and 2020 diagnosis years. In 2019, the proportion of stageable cancer diagnoses with a registered stage fell from 85% in 2018 to 76%. For the 2020 diagnosis year, stage completeness increased to 81%.
		- Values for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are in a combined code (E67000002).
