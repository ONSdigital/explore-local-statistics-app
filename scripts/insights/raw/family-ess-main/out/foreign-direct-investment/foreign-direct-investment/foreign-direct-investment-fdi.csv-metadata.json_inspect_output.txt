		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		 Foreign direct investment (FDI) is cross-border investment made with the objective of establishing a lasting interest in the host economy. FDI is also defined by control relationships, where the direct investor (parent company) controls at least 10% of the voting power (ordinary shares) of the direct investment enterprise. These relationships can be measured in two directions: 
		 - outward: the direct investments of UK-resident companies in other countries 
		 - inward: the direct investments in the UK from non-resident companies
