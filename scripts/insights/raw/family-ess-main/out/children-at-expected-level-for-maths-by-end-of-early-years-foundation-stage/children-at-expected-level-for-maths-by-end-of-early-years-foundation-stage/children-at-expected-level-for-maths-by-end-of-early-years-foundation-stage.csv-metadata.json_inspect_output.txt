          - Comment: Early years foundation stage profile outcomes of 5 year olds. Percentage at 'expected level' across all mathematics learning goals, England (state-funded schools), academic year 2021/22.
          - Description: This dataset shows the early years foundation stage profile outcomes of 5 year olds. Percentage at 'expected level' across all mathematics learning goals, in England (state-funded schools), for academic year 2021/22.
		
		### Coverage 
		
		England (state-funded schools)
		
		#### Geography definition
		
		Local Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,
		Counties,
		Regions,
		Nation (England)

		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Early years foundation stage profile was revised significantly in September 2021. It is therefore not possible to directly compare 2021/22 assessment outcomes with earlier years. Results are published by DfE and there are some differences between the results broken down by upper tier local authorities (based on the location of the submitting authority) and those by lower tier local authorities (based on the postcode of the school or provider). For more information, please refer to [Early years foundation stage profile results Methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-results-methodology). 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. 
		For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).
