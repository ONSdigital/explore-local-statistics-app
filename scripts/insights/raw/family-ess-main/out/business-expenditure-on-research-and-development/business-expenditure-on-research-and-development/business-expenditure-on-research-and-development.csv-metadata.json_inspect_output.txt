		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Statistics presented are compiled in line with internationally-agreed best practice as defined in the Frascati Manual 2015 by the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://www.oecd.org/publications/frascati-manual-2015-9789264239012-en.htm).
		
		Regional estimates are compiled based on a combination of larger businesses reporting their R&D performing locations and smaller businesses having their data allocated to the location of their main business address held on the inter-departmental business register.
		
		Estimates produced at disaggregate levels such as region, product group and SIC may in some cases be subject to a high level of variability from year to year. This may be due to industry reclassification of some businesses and sampling variability.
