          - Description: This dataset shows apprenticeships achieved by adults aged 16+ based on home address, rate per 100,000 population, in England, for full academic years 2017/18 to 2021/22. Figures for 2022/23 are available for August 2022 to January 2023.

		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Achievements for 2022/23 are provisional and cover August 2022 to January 2023. 2021/22 achievements are finalised and cover the full academic year.
		- Achievements are the count of apprenticeships achieved at any point during the stated academic period. Learners achieving more than one apprenticeship will appear more than once.
		- Geography is based upon the home postcode of the learner.
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. 
		For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).
