		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Data have been updated for years 2001 to 2022, and therefore cover the COVID-19 pandemic. The official population estimates for mid-2012 to mid-2020 have been revised, to incorporate the data now available from Census 2021. The data for this indicator has been revised to use the rebased population estimates from 2012 onwards. 
		- Values for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are in a combined code (E67000002). Values for Hackney and City of London are in a combined code (E67000001).
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
