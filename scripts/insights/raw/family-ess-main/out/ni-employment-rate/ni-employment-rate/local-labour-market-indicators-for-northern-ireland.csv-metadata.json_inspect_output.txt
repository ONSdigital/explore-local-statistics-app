          - Comment: Employment rate and economic inactivity rate for people aged between 16 and 64 years, Northern Ireland, 2022.
          - Description: This dataset shows:
		
		Employment rate age 16 to 64 
		 - the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years in paid work or who had a job that they were temporarily away from 
		
		Economic inactivity rate age 16 to 64 
		 - the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years who are not in employment but do not meet the internationally accepted definition of unemployment because they have not been seeking work within the last four weeks or they are unable to start work in the next two weeks 
		
		 In Northern Ireland, for 2022.
		
		### Coverage 
		
		Northern Ireland
		
		### Geography definition
		
		Local Government Districts, 
		Nation (Northern Ireland)
		
		### Source
		
		 - Northern Ireland: [Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/labour-market-and-social-welfare/labour-force-survey) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Calculation of employment rate: number of employed people aged 16 to 64 years divided by the population aged 16 to 64 years. Population is the sum of employed plus unemployed plus inactive. 
		
		Calculation of economic inactivity rate: number of economically inactive people aged 16 to 64 years divided by the population aged 16 to 64 years. Population is the sum of employed plus unemployed plus inactive. 
		
		Time series data is available at [NISRA](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/labour-market-status-sub-population-tables). 
		
		Because the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a sample survey, results are subject to sampling error, i.e. the actual proportion of the population in private households with a particular characteristic may differ from the proportion of the LFS sample with that characteristic. 
		
		The population totals used for the latest LFS estimates use projected growth rates from RTI data for UK, EU and non-EU populations based on 2021 patterns. The total population used for the LFS therefore does not take into account any changes in migration, birth rates, death rates etc. since June 2021 and hence levels estimates may be under- or over-estimating the true values and should be used with caution. Estimates of rates will, however, be robust.
