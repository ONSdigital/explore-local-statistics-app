          - Comment: Percentage of pupils in state-funded schools meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at the end of key stage 2, England (state-funded schools), academic years 2015/16 - 2022/23
          - Description: This dataset shows the percentage of pupils in state-funded schools meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at the end of key stage 2, in England state-funded schools, for academic years 2015/16 - 2022/23.
		
		### Coverage 
		
		England (state-funded schools)
		
		#### Geography definition
		
		Counties and Unitary Authorities,
		Regions,
		Nation (England)
		
		### Source

		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- All figures include LA maintained schools, academies and free schools. Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.
		- Figures for 2023 are based on revised data. Figures for other years are based on final data.
		- Data is not available for 2020 and 2021 as assessments were cancelled in these years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
		- Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks. 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
