          - Comment: Employment rate and economic inactivity rate for people aged between 16 and 64 years (official statistics in development), Great Britain (Northern Ireland national figure included), 2004 to 2023.
          - Description: This dataset shows:
		
		Employment rate age 16 to 64 
		 - the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years in paid work or who had a job that they were temporarily away from (official statistics in development) 
		
		Economic inactivity rate age 16 to 64 
		 - the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years who are not in employment but do not meet the internationally accepted definition of unemployment because they have not been seeking work within the last four weeks or they are unable to start work in the next two weeks (official statistics in development) 
		
		 In Great Britain (Northern Ireland national figure included), for periods 2004 to 2023.
		
		### Coverage 
		
		GB (England, Wales and Scotland). Northern Ireland national figure included.
		
		### Geography definition
		
		Local Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities, 
		Counties, 
		Combined Authorities, 
		Regions, 
		Nations (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland), 
		Countries (UK, GB, England and Wales)

		Data is also available on [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=17) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Calculation of employment rate: number of employed people aged 16 to 64 years divided by the population aged 16 to 64 years. Population is the sum of employed plus unemployed plus inactive. 
		
		Calculation of economic inactivity rate: number of economically inactive people aged 16 to 64 years divided by the population aged 16 to 64 years. Population is the sum of employed plus unemployed plus inactive. 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. 
		For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).
