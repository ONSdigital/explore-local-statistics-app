          - Identifier: England and Wales lower layer super output areas gross value added (GVA) estimates
          - Comment: Provides GVA estimates for lower layer super output areas (LSOA, England and Wales), 1998 to 2020.
          - Description: Gross value added (GVA) is the value generated by any economic unit that produces goods and services. It reflects the value of goods and services produced, less the cost of any inputs used up in that production process. GVA is a standard measure of the economic activity taking place in an area. It comprises the majority of gross domestic product (GDP), only excluding taxes and subsidies on products (such as Value Added Tax and duty on fuel or alcohol). GVA for the UK as a whole is measured by the UK National Accounts and published each year in the annual Blue Book. The GVA is then broken down to individual countries, regions, and local authority districts.
		
		These experimental statistics continue the disaggregation of GVA figures to lower layer super output area (LSOA, England and Wales) level. The LSOA data are building blocks that allow users the flexibility to build their own geographies for analysis. We do not recommend comparing the LSOA data directly. Instead, we recommend using the building blocks to build up other areas of interest and/or to analyse small areas within larger areas of interest.
