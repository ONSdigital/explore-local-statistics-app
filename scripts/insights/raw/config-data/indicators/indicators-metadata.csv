As unemployed form a small percentage of the population, the Annual Population Survey (APS) unemployment estimates within local authorities are based on very small samples so for many areas are unreliable. To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. 
The model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes.

'Total devices' represent publicly available charging devices at all speeds. A device can have a number of connectors of varying speeds.

There may be notable large reductions seen at local authority level in these statistics when comparing to a previous quarter. This is sometimes caused by a delay between when chargepoint operators decommission older devices in an area and when this information is reported in the source Zapmap data. Reductions caused by this often occur while chargepoint operators move their data reporting onto the open chargepoint interface to comply with the public chargepoint regulations, resulting in more accurate reporting.

The most recent population figures by Local Authority are sourced from the Office for National Statistics Population estimates for mid-year 2022. For quarters from July 2020 to April 2021, the population figures were sourced from 2019 estimates. Prior to July 2020, the population figures were sourced from the 2018 estimates.",F,ltla,F
