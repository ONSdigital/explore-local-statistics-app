To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. \nThe model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes. \nRefer to the [user guide (pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/labour-market/subnational-labour/model-based-estimates-of-ilo-unemployment-for-lad-uas-in-great-britain---guide-for-users.pdf) for further details.","confidenceIntervals":"T","initialGeographyLevel":"ltla"},"inferredGeos":{"ctrys":["E","S","W"],"types":["E06","E07","E08","E09","E12","E47","E92","K03","K04","S12","S92","W06","W92"],"groups":[{"key":"ctry","codes":["E92","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries"},{"key":"rgn","codes":["E12","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries and regions"},{"key":"cauth","codes":["E47"],"label":"Combined authorities"},{"key":"ltla","codes":["E06","E07","E08","E09","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Lower-tier/unitary authorities"}],"year":2018},"years":[2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022]},"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head":{"id":2,"topic":"economy","subTopic":"pay and income","code":"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head","periodGroup":2,"":"Gross disposable household income","minXDomainNumb":1997,"maxXDomainNumb":2021,"metadata":{"code":"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head","slug":"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head","label":"Gross disposable household income","prefix":"£","suffix":"","subText":null,"decimalPlaces":0,"howToMeasureChange":"abs","subtitle":"Average income per person after taxes and direct benefits","zeroBaseline":"F","canBeNegative":"F","experimentalStatistic":"F","sourceDate":"14/09/2023","sourceURL":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/bulletins/regionalgrossdisposablehouseholdincomegdhi/previousReleases#","sourceOrg":"Office for National Statistics","longDescription":"This indicator shows an estimate of the amount of money each individual within a household has available for spending or saving after they have paid taxes and received any direct benefits, in the UK, for 1997-2021.","standardised":"T","caveats":null,"confidenceIntervals":"F","initialGeographyLevel":"ltla"},"inferredGeos":{"ctrys":["E","N","S","W"],"types":["E06","E07","E08","E09","E12","E92","K02","K03","K04","N09","N92","S12","S92","W06","W92"],"groups":[{"key":"uk","codes":["K02"],"label":"United Kingdom"},{"key":"ctry","codes":["E92","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries"},{"key":"rgn","codes":["E12","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries and regions"},{"key":"ltla","codes":["E06","E07","E08","E09","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Lower-tier/unitary authorities"}],"year":2021},"years":[1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021]},"gross-median-weekly-pay":{"id":21,"topic":"economy","subTopic":"pay and income","code":"gross-median-weekly-pay","periodGroup":21,"":"Gross median weekly pay","minXDomainNumb":2002,"maxXDomainNumb":2023,"metadata":{"code":"gross-median-weekly-pay","slug":"gross-median-weekly-pay","label":"Gross median weekly pay","prefix":"£","suffix":"","subText":null,"decimalPlaces":0,"howToMeasureChange":"abs","subtitle":"Average weekly pay based on where people live","zeroBaseline":"F","canBeNegative":"F","experimentalStatistic":"F","sourceDate":"01/11/2023|01/11/2023","sourceURL":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/previousReleases|https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/labour-market-and-social-welfare/annual-survey-hours-and-earnings","sourceOrg":"Office for National Statistics|Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency","longDescription":"This indicator shows the average (median) weekly pay based on where people live, in the UK, for 2002-2023.","standardised":"T","caveats":"The country level figure for Northern Ireland has been sourced from NOMIS rather than NISRA.
