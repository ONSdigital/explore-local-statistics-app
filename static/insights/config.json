The UC claimants that are included are 1) those that were recorded as not in employment (May 2013-April 2015), and 2) those claimants of Universal Credit who are required to search for work, i.e. within the Searching for Work conditionality regime as defined by the Department for Work & Pensions (from April 2015 onwards).\n\nThe count is based on live claims on the second Thursday of the reference month.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, some people are able to claim both contribution-based JSA and UC at the same time. Consequently, there has been a small amount of double counting. Information from DWP suggests this double counting increased at the start of the pandemic and has stabilised at approximately 1.0 to 1.5% of the Claimant Count.\n\nNorthern Ireland local government districts Claimant Count figures are only available from 2013 onwards.","confidenceIntervals":"F","initialGeographyLevel":"ltla","beeswarmRowUseMinMax":"F"},"inferredGeos":{"ctrys":["E","N","S","W"],"types":["E06","E07","E08","E09","E10","E12","E47","E92","K02","K03","K04","N09","N92","S12","S92","W06","W92"],"groups":[{"key":"uk","codes":["K02"],"label":"United Kingdom"},{"key":"ctry","codes":["E92","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries"},{"key":"rgn","codes":["E12","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries and regions"},{"key":"cauth","codes":["E47"],"label":"Combined authorities"},{"key":"utla","codes":["E06","E08","E09","E10","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Upper-tier/unitary authorities"},{"key":"ltla","codes":["E06","E07","E08","E09","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Lower-tier/unitary authorities"}],"year":2023},"years":[2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023,2024]},"gdp-per-head-Gross domestic product per head at current market price":{"id":85,"topic":"economy","subTopic":"productivity","code":"gdp-per-head-Gross domestic product per head at current market price","":null,"minXDomainNumb":1998,"maxXDomainNumb":2022,"metadata":{"code":"gdp-per-head-Gross domestic product per head at current market price","slug":"gross-domestic-product-per-head-at-current-market-price","label":"Gross domestic product per head at current market prices","prefix":"£","suffix":"","subText":null,"decimalPlaces":0,"howToMeasureChange":null,"subtitle":"GDP per head including the effects of inflation","zeroBaseline":"F","canBeNegative":"F","experimentalStatistic":"F","sourceDate":"24/04/2024","sourceURL":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/regionaleconomicactivitybygrossdomesticproductuk/previousreleases","sourceOrg":"Office for National Statistics","longDescription":"This indicator shows gross domestic product (GDP) per head at current market prices in pounds, in the UK, for 1998 to 2022.","standardised":"T","caveats":"This time series includes the effects of inflation and is most useful for comparison of levels between different areas.\n\n2022 data are provisional.\n\nData for the City of London has been excluded from the visualisations on this service due to its very high GDP figures and very low population, which distort the overall representation.
