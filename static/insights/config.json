Because of increased volatility of LFS and APS estimates, estimates of change should be treated with additional caution.\n\nThe model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes.\n\nRefer to the [user guide (pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/labour-market/subnational-labour/model-based-estimates-of-ilo-unemployment-for-lad-uas-in-great-britain---guide-for-users.pdf) for further details.","confidenceIntervals":"T","initialGeographyLevel":"ltla","beeswarmRowUseMinMax":"F"},"inferredGeos":{"ctrys":["E","S","W"],"types":["E06","E07","E08","E09","E12","E47","E92","K03","K04","S12","S92","W06","W92"],"groups":[{"key":"ctry","codes":["E92","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries"},{"key":"rgn","codes":["E12","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries and regions"},{"key":"cauth","codes":["E47"],"label":"Combined authorities"},{"key":"ltla","codes":["E06","E07","E08","E09","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Lower-tier/unitary authorities"}],"year":2021},"years":[2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023]},"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head":{"id":2,"topic":"economy","subTopic":"pay and income","code":"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head","":null,"minXDomainNumb":1997,"maxXDomainNumb":2022,"metadata":{"code":"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head","slug":"gross-disposable-household-income-per-head","label":"Gross disposable household income","prefix":"£","suffix":"","subText":null,"decimalPlaces":0,"howToMeasureChange":"abs","subtitle":"Average income per person (£) after taxes and direct benefits","zeroBaseline":"F","canBeNegative":"F","experimentalStatistic":"F","sourceDate":"04/09/2024","sourceURL":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/regionalaccounts/grossdisposablehouseholdincome/bulletins/regionalgrossdisposablehouseholdincomegdhi/previousReleases","sourceOrg":"Office for National Statistics","longDescription":"This indicator shows an estimate of the amount of money each individual within a household has available for spending or saving after they have paid taxes and received any direct benefits, in pounds, in the UK, for 1997 to 2022.","standardised":"T","caveats":"Figures for 2022 are provisional, as national estimates have not been through supply and use balancing at the time of the data source publication.","confidenceIntervals":"F","initialGeographyLevel":"ltla","beeswarmRowUseMinMax":"F"},"inferredGeos":{"ctrys":["E","N","S","W"],"types":["E06","E07","E08","E09","E10","E12","E47","E92","K02","K03","K04","N09","N92","S12","S92","W06","W92"],"groups":[{"key":"uk","codes":["K02"],"label":"United Kingdom"},{"key":"ctry","codes":["E92","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries"},{"key":"rgn","codes":["E12","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries and regions"},{"key":"cauth","codes":["E47"],"label":"Combined authorities"},{"key":"utla","codes":["E06","E08","E09","E10","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Upper-tier/unitary authorities"},{"key":"ltla","codes":["E06","E07","E08","E09","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Lower-tier/unitary authorities"}],"year":2023},"years":[1997,1998,1999,2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022]},"gross-median-weekly-pay":{"id":21,"topic":"economy","subTopic":"pay and income","code":"gross-median-weekly-pay","":null,"minXDomainNumb":2008,"maxXDomainNumb":2024,"metadata":{"code":"gross-median-weekly-pay","slug":"gross-median-weekly-pay","label":"Gross median weekly pay","prefix":"£","suffix":"","subText":null,"decimalPlaces":0,"howToMeasureChange":"abs","subtitle":"Average weekly pay based on where people live","zeroBaseline":"F","canBeNegative":"F","experimentalStatistic":"F","sourceDate":"29/10/2024|29/10/2024","sourceURL":"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/previousReleases|https://www.nisra.gov.uk/statistics/labour-market-and-social-welfare/annual-survey-hours-and-earnings","sourceOrg":"Office for National Statistics|Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency","longDescription":"This indicator shows the average (median) weekly pay based on where people live, in the UK, for a pay period in April 2008 to April 2024.","standardised":"T","caveats":"For Great Britain data, 2024 estimates are provisional and relate to the pay period that includes 17 April 2024.

A device can have a number of connectors of varying speeds.\n\nThere may be large increases or reductions seen at local authority level in these statistics when comparing to a previous quarter and these should be considered in the context of longer-term trends. This can be caused by a number of factors, including a large group of devices being added to or decommissioned from source Zapmap data at a time. This can in turn be caused by delays between chargepoint operator activity and this information filtering through to Zapmap data.\n\nA specific example of this is Hammersmith and Fulham, which shows a sharp increase in mid-2023. This was due to the completion of a large On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS) project, which significantly boosted the number of devices recorded in that area during that period.\n\nThe most recent population figures by Local Authority are sourced from the Office for National Statistics Population estimates for mid-year 2022.
