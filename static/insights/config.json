The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes.\n\nRefer to the [user guide (pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/labour-market/subnational-labour/model-based-estimates-of-ilo-unemployment-for-lad-uas-in-great-britain---guide-for-users.pdf) for further details.","confidenceIntervals":"T","initialGeographyLevel":"ltla","beeswarmRowUseMinMax":"F"},"inferredGeos":{"ctrys":["E","S","W"],"types":["E06","E07","E08","E09","E12","E47","E92","K03","K04","S12","S92","W06","W92"],"groups":[{"key":"ctry","codes":["E92","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries"},{"key":"rgn","codes":["E12","S92","N92","W92"],"label":"Countries and regions"},{"key":"cauth","codes":["E47"],"label":"Combined authorities"},{"key":"ltla","codes":["E06","E07","E08","E09","N09","S12","W06"],"label":"Lower-tier/unitary authorities"}],"year":2021},"years":[2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022,2023]},"proportion-of-people-who-are-economically-inactive-due-to-sickness":{"id":80,"topic":"economy","subTopic":"employment","code":"proportion-of-people-who-are-economically-inactive-due-to-sickness","minXDomainNumb":2004,"maxXDomainNumb":2023,"metadata":{"code":"proportion-of-people-who-are-economically-inactive-due-to-sickness","slug":"proportion-of-people-who-are-economically-inactive-due-to-sickness","label":"Economically inactive people due to long-term sickness","prefix":"","suffix":"%","subText":null,"decimalPlaces":1,"howToMeasureChange":null,"subtitle":"Percentage of economically inactive people who are economically inactive due to health problems lasting for longer than 12 months","zeroBaseline":"F","canBeNegative":"F","experimentalStatistic":"F","sourceDate":"16/04/2024","sourceURL":"https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=17","sourceOrg":"Office for National Statistics","longDescription":"This indicator shows the percentage of economically inactive people who are economically inactive due to health problems lasting for longer than 12 months, in Great Britain (Northern Ireland national figure included), for 2004 - 2022.","standardised":"T","caveats":"This indicator is based on re-weighted Annual Population Survey datasets updated on 16 August 2022.
