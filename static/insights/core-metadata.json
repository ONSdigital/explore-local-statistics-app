				"longDescription": "This indicator shows model-based estimates for the proportion of economically active people aged 16 years and over without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks (official statistics in development), in Great Britain, for periods 2004 to 2023.",
				"standardised": "T",
				"caveats": "Unemployment rates are calculated as a percentage of aged 16 years and over economically active population.\n\nAs unemployed form a small percentage of the population, the Annual Population Survey (APS) unemployment estimates within local authorities are based on very small samples so for many areas are unreliable. To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities.\n\nThe ongoing challenges with response rates, response levels and weighting approach mean that labour market statistics based on both the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) will be considered [official statistics in development](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/policies/official-statistics-policies/official-statistics-in-development/) until further review. Because of increased volatility of LFS and APS estimates, estimates of change should be treated with additional caution.\n\nThe model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes.\n\nRefer to the [user guide (pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/labour-market/subnational-labour/model-based-estimates-of-ilo-unemployment-for-lad-uas-in-great-britain---guide-for-users.pdf) for further details.",

The UC claimants that are included are 1) those that were recorded as not in employment (May 2013-April 2015), and 2) those claimants of Universal Credit who are required to search for work, i.e. within the Searching for Work conditionality regime as defined by the Department for Work & Pensions (from April 2015 onwards).\n\nThe count is based on live claims on the second Thursday of the reference month.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, some people are able to claim both contribution-based JSA and UC at the same time. Consequently, there has been a small amount of double counting. Information from DWP suggests this double counting increased at the start of the pandemic and has stabilised at approximately 1.0 to 1.5% of the Claimant Count.\n\nNorthern Ireland local government districts Claimant Count figures are only available from 2013 onwards.",
