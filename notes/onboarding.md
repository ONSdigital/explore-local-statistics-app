Here are the steps to get started working on ELS

- [Set up two factor authentication on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)
- [Generate a GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
- [Add GPG key to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
- [Generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- [Connect SSH key to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
- Log a servicenow request to be added to the ONSdigital GitHub Organisation
- Ask Pete Montgomery to add you to the [ELS repo](https://github.com/ONSdigital/explore-local-statistics-app).

If generating a GPG key on windows, I recommend downloading [gpg4win](https://gpg4win.org/download.html). Then you can run the `gpg` commands through powershell.
