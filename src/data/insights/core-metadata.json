To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities.\n\nThe ongoing challenges with response rates, response levels and weighting approach mean that labour market statistics based on both the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) will be considered [official statistics in development](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/policies/official-statistics-policies/official-statistics-in-development/) until further review. Because of increased volatility of LFS and APS estimates, estimates of change should be treated with additional caution.\n\nUpdates to this indicator have been temporarily suspended until the APS reweighting is implemented in 2026.\n\nThe model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes.\n\nRefer to the [user guide (pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/labour-market/subnational-labour/model-based-estimates-of-ilo-unemployment-for-lad-uas-in-great-britain---guide-for-users.pdf) for further details.",

				"standardised": "T",
				"caveats": "Current smoker estimates for each local authority can vary a lot from year to year because of small sample sizes. So, this indicator has moved to a five-year average to give a clearer picture of how smoking prevalence varies between local authority areas, rather than focusing on one year's figures.\n\nThe averages presented are five-year averages, calculated using data from 2019 to 2023 and 2020 to 2024, where available.\n\nThe five-year estimates have ranges of uncertainty (confidence intervals), which can be displayed by selecting the ‘Options’ button next to the bar and line charts.\n\nNorth Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire averages are based on a 3-year average (2022 to 2024), because of boundary changes.\n\nCity of London and Buckinghamshire Unitary Authority averages are based on a 4-year average (2021 to 2024), because of boundary changes.\n\nDue to minor boundary changes in 2024, Local Authority codes were updated for Barnsley and Sheffield. Barnsley changed from E08000016 to E08000038, and Sheffield changed from E08000019 to E08000039. These changes did not affect comparability.\n\nTo account for the discontinuity caused by the move to telephone-only interviewing in 2020, a weighting adjustment was introduced for APS data from 2020 to 2023. A single factor was applied to the existing APS weights to give an adjusted weight, which reduced the discontinuity effect caused by the change in method of data collection. For the 2024 release, a revised weighting approach was developed, applying separate scaling factors for each year, reflecting the return to mixed mode (face-to-face and telephone) interviewing at the end of 2023. Estimates from 2020 to 2023 have been revised to reflect the updated approach. The weighting approach has not been applied to 2024 estimates because of the return to mixed mode interviewing.

A device can have a number of connectors of varying speeds.\n\nThere may be large increases or reductions seen at local authority level in these statistics when comparing to a previous quarter and these should be considered in the context of longer-term trends. This can be caused by a number of factors, including a large group of devices being added to or decommissioned from source Zapmap data at a time. This can in turn be caused by delays between chargepoint operator activity and this information filtering through to Zapmap data.\n\nA specific example of this is Hammersmith and Fulham, which shows a sharp increase in mid-2023. This was due to the completion of a large On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS) project, which significantly boosted the number of devices recorded in that area during that period.\n\nThe most recent population figures by Local Authority are sourced from the Office for National Statistics Population estimates for mid-year 2022. For quarters from July 2020 (2020-07) to April 2021 (2021-04), the population figures were sourced from 2019 estimates. Prior to July 2020 (2020-07), the population figures were sourced from the 2018 estimates.",

The UC claimants that are included are 1) those that were recorded as not in employment (May 2013-April 2015), and 2) those claimants of Universal Credit who are required to search for work, i.e. within the Searching for Work conditionality regime as defined by the Department for Work & Pensions (from April 2015 onwards).\n\nThe count is based on live claims on the second Thursday of the reference month.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, some people are able to claim both contribution-based JSA and UC at the same time. Consequently, there has been a small amount of double counting. Information from DWP suggests this double counting increased at the start of the pandemic and has stabilised at approximately 1.0 to 1.5% of the Claimant Count.\n\nNorthern Ireland local government districts Claimant Count figures are only available from 2013 onwards.",
